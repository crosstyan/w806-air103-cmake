/**
 * @brief Reads a 32-bit value from a memory-mapped hardware register or memory location.
 *
 * This function reads a 32-bit unsigned integer value from the specified memory address.
 * It is commonly used for accessing hardware registers in memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) regions.
 *
 * @param addr The memory address to read from. It should be a valid pointer to a volatile memory location.
 * @return The 32-bit unsigned integer value read from the specified memory address.
 *
 * @note The memory address is treated as volatile to prevent compiler optimizations that may affect the intended behavior.
 *
 * @warning This function directly accesses memory-mapped hardware registers. Ensure that the address is valid and accessible.

   * No one knows what this magic number is for.
   * Some random article on the internet says it's for the SysTick timer.
   * But I can't find any reference to it in the datasheet.
   *
   * Apparently one must read the register to clear the interrupt flag,
   * Otherwise no more interrupt will be triggered.
   *
   * Wait...? This moron find the register in Arm Cortex-M0 Documentation, how could
   * that relate to WinnerMicro W806?! It's a different architecture!
   *
   * Unless the moron who designed this chip is a fan of Arm Cortex-M0 and decided to
   * map the SysTick register to the same address as the Arm Cortex-M0. But why it
   * doesn't mention it in the datasheet?!
   *
   * 0xE000'0000 - 0xFFFF'FFFF is called System Level Peripheral, without giving any
   * documentation about it. It's like a black box that no one knows what's inside.
   * Luckily, `core_804.h` is open source and still readable, although not enough
   * details given. Better than nothing.
   *
   * That's weird. I'll just leave it here.
